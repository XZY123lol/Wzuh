## Documentation
Here are only the main scripts, more scripts here: https://wzuh.github.io/docs

`pik<Hello, world>` - Super simplified text output to the console, made like a print, only a little shorter.
`set x = 10` - Creates a variable

Mathematical scripts:
`add 2 + 2` - Add a number.
`sub 70 - 6` - Decreases the number.
By the way, they also work with variables like this `add x + y`, `sub 20 - years`.
